TBlockTool [options] [load] [platform] [export]


Options or Misc. Features:
-EXIT		// exits the app after it's done(doesn't go to main window)
-WAIT		// waits on cmdline window after done
-NOERR		// no wait if error(otherwise if ERROR happened it would wait)
-LOG filename	// log output to filename
-MIN		// starts minimized

Load/Export:
-I filename	// imports filename(.tex or .txt)
-E filename	// exports to filename(.tex or .txt)
-IE filename	// imports filename(.tex or .txt) then exports it
filename	// same as -I (implied)

Platform switches:
-PS2
-GC
-XBOX
-PC

Some examples(I'm leaving out the tblocktool.exe name to be lazy typing):

"dumb.tex"  ->this loads up dumb.tex(what you can use to double-click files)
-PS2 -IE "dumb.tex"  ->load up dumb.tex, export for PS2
-EXIT -I "test.txt" -PS2 -E "ps2.tex" -GC -E "gcube.tex"  ->load test.txt, export ps2.tex in PS2 format, then export gcube.tex in gamecube format, exits app

You can then use this stuff in combination with batch file commands to re-export tons of files at once, like using the FOR loop, passing the filename to the tool with -IE and a platform switch.



// only for text files you are importing
OTHER FEATURES:
Try exporting a .tex file to a .txt(text) file.  You'll see that individual textures can have different settings than what's set for the rest of them(global).  Mess around with the settings of a particular texture(s) and re-export as a text file to see how the syntax works for re-importing a text file with those settings.
